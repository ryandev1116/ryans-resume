    <title>Ryan's Hobbies</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>When I'm not working...</h1>
<p>Outside of work, I have a deep passion for motorcycling, particularly enjoying the thrill and serenity of navigating through mountain twisties. There's nothing quite like the feeling of freedom and adventure that comes with each ride. I'm also an enthusiastic reader, constantly diving into both fiction and non-fiction novels. Whether it's exploring imaginative worlds or gaining new insights from real-life stories, I find great joy and inspiration in reading.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am an avid console gamer, where I immerse myself in diverse and captivating virtual realms, always eager for the next exciting challenge or storyline. These hobbies not only provide me with relaxation and enjoyment but also inspire creativity and continuous learning. I love connecting with like-minded individuals, so feel free to reach out to me at ryanicasas@gmail.com or +63917-159-7926. Let's chat and share our passions!</p>
